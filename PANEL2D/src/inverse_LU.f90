!  This program developed in FORTRAN is a Finite Element solver for linear-
!  static analyses as well as linearized stability analyses. It is inherently
!  coupled to the open-source panel method APAME for providing fluid-structure-
!  interaction capabilites.

!-----------------------------------------------------------
! input ...
! a(n,n) - array of coefficients for matrix A
! n      - dimension
! output ...
! c(n,n) - inverse matrix of A
! comments ...
! the original matrix a(n,n) will be destroyed 
! during the calculation

implicit none 
integer n
double precision a(n,n), c(n,n)
double precision L(n,n), U(n,n), b(n), d(n), x(n)
double precision coeff
integer i, j, k

! step 0: initialization for matrices L and U and b
! Fortran 90/95 aloows such operations on matrices
L=0.d0
U=0.d0
b=0.d0

! step 1: forward elimination
do k=1, n-1
   do i=k+1,n
      coeff=a(i,k)/a(k,k)
      L(i,k) = coeff
      do j=k+1,n
         a(i,j) = a(i,j)-coeff*a(k,j)
      end do
   end do
end do

! Step 2: prepare L and U matrices 
! L matrix is a matrix of the elimination coefficient
! + the diagonal elements are 1.0
do i=1,n
  L(i,i) = 1.d0
end do
! U matrix is the upper triangular part of A
do j=1,n
  do i=1,j
    U(i,j) = a(i,j)
  end do
end do

! Step 3: compute columns of the inverse matrix C
do k=1,n
  b(k)=1.d0
  d(1) = b(1)
! Step 3a: Solve Ld=b using the forward substitution
  do i=2,n
    d(i)=b(i)
    do j=1,i-1
      d(i) = d(i) - L(i,j)*d(j)
    end do
  end do
! Step 3b: Solve Ux=d using the back substitution
  x(n)=d(n)/U(n,n)
  do i = n-1,1,-1
    x(i) = d(i)
    do j=n,i+1,-1
      x(i)=x(i)-U(i,j)*x(j)
    end do
    x(i) = x(i)/u(i,i)
  end do
! Step 3c: fill the solutions x(n) into column k of C
  do i=1,n
    c(i,k) = x(i)
  end do
  b(k)=0.d0
end do
